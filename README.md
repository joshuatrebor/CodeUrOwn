 **Java Source code plagiarism detection**
 
 This is a simple project I created when I'm still studying Java in my 2nd year as a CS student. There is a common culture amongst the programming classes in my College back then, copying of codes during submissions of machine problems and assignments.
 
Being a good student, I don't want to tolerate this kinds of practices! hehe So I created a Java program that detects plagiarism and clusters plagiarized codes in groups of basic Java codes.
